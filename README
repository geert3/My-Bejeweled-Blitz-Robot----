FIRST WARNING
-------------
this is very quick and very dirty code, never intended to be published,
never even meant to live longer than a day or two on my own PC.
I've put it here anyway since some people asked for it. 
So there you go. Do anything you like to/with it.
But __please__ don't judge my coding skills on this. 
In real life I DO comment my code. Honestly.
(END OF FIRST WARNING)

SECOND WARNING
--------------
This code is a "robot" application. If you run it, and hit the "start" button, it will take over your
mouse for the duration of "one minute" (in the famous Bejeweled Blitz dark voice).
It will start clicking like hell to get a good score, but the flipside is that if you're not
currently on a bejeweled play field, it may click anything else in sight.
This may have bad consequences, and it's VERY hard to stop it while your mouse pointer is going crazy.
An emergency break key combination would have been a good idea but life's too short to be careful.
So be careful.
(END OF SECOND WARNING)

HOW TO BUILD
------------
The folder "JewelRobot" is in fact an Eclipse project, but you may just as well compile the stuff in
"JewelRobot/src" by hand, and run the main class "JewelRobot.class"

HOW TO USE
----------
- surf to the Bejeweled Blitz page, until you see the play field.
- run the JewelRobot. It will open a window, showing a rectangular portion of your screen.
- move the browser so that the play field completely falls within the rectangular portion copied by the Robot.
  (this is the manual calibration - if you fail here, you'll get lousy scores!)
- Now hit the "play" button in the browser, and then the "start" button in the Robot window.
- the small grid in the Robot's window is a view of what he thinks he "sees" in the play field. 
  Keep an eye on that to see if you've calibrated well enough.
- Watch that score reach 1 million points while you're sipping your cola ;-)
- EXCELLENT - AMAZING
